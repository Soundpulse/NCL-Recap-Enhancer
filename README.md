# NCL-Recap-Enhancer

### Special Thanks

TThomasV/CU-Panopto-Downloader shamelessly copied and used his code as the base of my recap fetcher :#, made modifications since ours can not be directly downloaded. 

carykh/jumpcutter included in the repo for a speedier video without the slient parts.

agermanidis/autosub used to generate the subtitles

MKVToolNix was used to merge the video and the subtitles together.

### TODO:

Files downloaded with that format has corrupted codecs
Make this into one executable that anyone else using Panopto can use this easily.
