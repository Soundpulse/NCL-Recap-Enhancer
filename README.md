# NCL-Recap-Enhancer

### Special Thanks

TThomasV/CU-Panopto-Downloader shamelessly copied and used his code as the base of my recap fetcher :#, made modifications since ours can not be directly downloaded. 

agermanidis/autosub used to generate the subtitle

used VLC to repair the mp4 files.

MKVToolNix was used to merge the video and the subtitles together.

carykh/jumpcutter included in the repo for a speedier video without the slient parts. (Did not use it as it does not acknowledge subtitles and also really really slow)


### TODO:

Make this into one executable that anyone else using Panopto can use this easily.
